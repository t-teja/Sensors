Python code example to read data from SHT20 Modbus RTU using "CUSTOM GENERAL PROTOCOL" which is factory default and also using Modbus protocol. The Custom General protocol does not use Modbus protocol and can be read directly using serial ASCII. For changing the XY-MD02 module to Modbus communication interface, use any serial tool and send "STOP" command to stop default General protocol and using Modbus protocol. use "PARAM" command to read the modbus configuration from the device like baudrate, slave address etc.
